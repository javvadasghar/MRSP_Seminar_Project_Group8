I downloaded 24-bit, 44100 kHz sound files from this website "https://freesound.org". Then, using Audacity, I created three versions of each sound: small, opera, and reverb environments. The sounds I used include drum kit, drums opera, smoothie party, traffic opera, and walking on leaves in a forest.
